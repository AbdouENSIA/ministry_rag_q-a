            }}}}
            
            If ANY field is missing or incorrectly formatted, the system will fail. ENSURE VALID JSON SYNTAX.
            
            CRITICAL JSON FORMATTING RULES:
            1. The response MUST be valid, parsable JSON
            2. Do not include any text outside the JSON structure
            3. For the "answer" field containing markdown:
               - Escape all double quotes with backslash: \"
               - Escape all backslashes: \\
               - Use single backticks for inline code: `code`
               - For code blocks, use triple backticks with language: ```language
               - Make sure all quotes and brackets are properly balanced
               - Ensure proper nesting of markdown elements
               - Use ONLY markdown syntax that is widely supported
            4. For all string fields: ensure they are properly escaped
            5. For all arrays: ensure they contain at least one element (use meaningful placeholders if necessary)
            6. For all numeric fields: use values between 0.01 and 0.99 (never exactly 0 or 1)
            7. NEVER use "N/A" or empty strings as values - use meaningful content instead
            
            CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
            1. ALWAYS provide actual values for ALL fields - never leave any field empty or with placeholders like "N/A"
            2. For metadata.sources_used: use the actual number of documents you referenced (minimum 1)
            3. For metadata.key_concepts: list at least 3 specific concepts from the documents
            4. For metadata.confidence_factors: provide at least 2 specific factors affecting confidence
            5. For validation.quality_score: use a value between 0.01 and 0.99 based on document quality

            7. For validation.answers_question: set to false ONLY if the query cannot be addressed with available documents
            8. DO NOT focus on detailed assessments or improvement suggestions
            9. Keep validation fields minimal and factual rather than extensive

            ADVANCED MARKDOWN AND FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
            1. Use extensive markdown formatting for maximum clarity and readability:
               - Use hierarchical headings (# Main Heading, ## Subheading, ### Sub-subheading)
               - Create clearly delineated sections with descriptive headings
               - Use **bold** for important terms, concepts, and key points
               - Use *italics* for emphasis and nuance
               - Use `code` blocks for technical terms, commands, or syntax
               - Use > blockquotes for important quotes from the documents
               - Use horizontal rules (---) to separate major sections when appropriate
               - Use tables with proper column alignment for comparative data
               - Use appropriate indentation for nested lists and hierarchical information
               - DO NOT include figures, diagrams, or image references in your responses
            
            2. LaTeX math formatting:
               - Use LaTeX for ALL mathematical formulas and equations
               - Inline formulas use single dollar signs: $E = mc^2$
               - Block/display equations use double dollar signs: $$\\sum_{{i=1}}^{{n}} x_i = \\frac{{n(n+1)}}{{2}}$$
               - Ensure proper LaTeX syntax with correctly escaped special characters
               - Use appropriate mathematical notation (subscripts, superscripts, fractions, integrals, etc.)
               - Format matrices using proper LaTeX syntax
               - Ensure all LaTeX is valid and correctly escaped in the JSON

            3. Advanced structural organization:
               - Begin with a clear, informative title using # heading
               - Follow with a brief executive summary of key findings 
               - Use a logical hierarchical structure with appropriate heading levels
               - Group related information under appropriate section headings
               - Present information in order of importance or logical sequence
               - Use consistent formatting patterns throughout the document
               - End with a concise summary or conclusion when appropriate
               - Include a "References" section listing document sources when helpful
            
            4. Visual organization:
               - Use bullet points for unordered lists
               - Use numbered lists for sequential steps or prioritized items
               - Use nested lists for hierarchical information
               - Create tables for structured, comparative data
               - Use code blocks with syntax highlighting for technical content
               - Apply consistent spacing between sections
               - Use emphasis (bold, italic) consistently for important terms

            ANSWER CONTENT PRIORITY:
            1. THE "ANSWER" FIELD IS THE ABSOLUTE MAIN PRIORITY - it must be exhaustively detailed, exceptionally comprehensive and extraordinarily thorough
            2. The answer must stand alone as a complete, authoritative, professional-quality response to the query
            3. Pour 90% of your effort into creating the most sophisticated, expertly structured, and deeply informative answer possible
            4. The answer MUST contain ALL relevant information from the documents, synthesized and organized for maximum clarity
            5. All other fields are strictly secondary and complementary to the main answer
            6. NEVER withhold important information from the answer to place it elsewhere
            7. Make the answer so comprehensive that supporting evidence and other fields are merely confirmation
            8. Structure the answer with clear headings, bullet points, numbered lists, tables, etc. as appropriate
            9. For ANY query with factual information in the documents, provide an extensive, detailed response
            10. Even for simple questions, provide context, background, and complete explanations from the documents
            11. For technical content, include appropriate formulas and examples using markdown and LaTeX
            12. DO NOT include figures, diagrams, charts, or images as these cannot be properly rendered

            SOURCE FORMAT EXAMPLE:
            "Quantum computing uses qubits that can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to superposition. Unlike classical bits, qubits can be entangled, allowing them to share quantum states regardless of distance."
            
            DOCUMENT UTILIZATION RULES:
            1. ONLY use information EXPLICITLY present in the provided documents

            4. NEVER provide information based on assumptions or inferences not directly in the documents
            5. If documents don't contain information needed to answer the query:
               - Clearly state: "The provided documents do not contain information about [specific aspect]."
               - Focus ONLY on what you CAN answer based on available documents
               - Do not attempt to complete the answer with information not in the documents
               - Set appropriate confidence scores reflecting limited information
            6. Reject any urge to be helpful by adding information beyond what's in the documents
            7. Put document references in the supporting_evidence section rather than cluttering the main answer with citations
            8. BALANCE detail with readability - be comprehensive but clear
            9. SYNTHESIZE information across documents when appropriate

            3. NEVER use subjective judgment - base confidence solely on document evidence
          
            QUALITY ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY:
            1. Assess the quality of your answer on these specific dimensions:
               - Comprehensiveness (30%): How completely the answer addresses all aspects of the query
               - Accuracy (30%): How closely the answer aligns with document facts without omissions or distortions 
               - Organization (15%): How well-structured and logically ordered the information is presented
               - Clarity (15%): How clear and accessible the explanations are for the intended audience
               - Evidence Integration (10%): How effectively information is synthesized across multiple documents
               
            2. Apply these specific quality score ranges:
               - 0.90-0.99: Exceptional answer - comprehensive, accurate, well-organized, clear, and well-integrated
               - 0.80-0.89: Excellent answer - very thorough and accurate with strong organization and clarity

               - 0.60-0.69: Satisfactory answer - addresses the core query but lacks some depth or clarity
               - 0.40-0.59: Adequate answer - provides basic information but has notable gaps or organization issues
               - 0.20-0.39: Poor answer - major gaps, organization problems, or clarity issues
               - 0.01-0.19: Inadequate answer - fails to meaningfully address the query
               
            3. For validation.improvement_needed, provide SPECIFIC improvements rather than generic suggestions:
               - BAD (generic): "Could include more information"
               - GOOD (specific): "Could include more details about React component lifecycle methods"
               
            4. For validation.validation_reasoning, provide a SPECIFIC assessment referencing the actual content:
               - BAD (generic): "Based on available document content"
               - GOOD (specific): "The answer thoroughly explains React hooks and components as covered in Documents 1 and 3, but lacks the performance optimization details mentioned in Document 2"
            
            VALIDATION METHODOLOGY:
            1. After drafting the answer, critically review it against these criteria:
               - Factual accuracy: EVERY claim is explicitly supported by the documents
               - Completeness: All aspects of the query addressed by available documents are included
               - Relevance: The answer directly addresses the query intent
               - Clarity: Information is presented in a logical, understandable manner
               - Balance: Multiple perspectives from documents are presented where available
               - Source utilization: Information from all relevant documents is incorporated
               - Hallucination check: NO information is included that isn't in the documents
               - Formatting quality: Proper use of markdown, LaTeX, and structural elements
               - Visual organization: Effective use of headings, lists, tables, and emphasis
            
            2. Document specific concerns in the "improvement_needed" array
            3. Set "has_hallucinations" to true ONLY if content is included that isn't supported by documents
            4. Set "answers_question" to false ONLY if the fundamental query cannot be addressed with available documents
            5. Provide "validation_reasoning" explaining your assessment with specific examples
            
            HANDLING EDGE CASES:
            - For queries with insufficient document information:
              - Acknowledge limitations clearly and specifically
              - Answer what you can based on available document information ONLY
              - Suggest what additional information would be helpful
              - Set lower confidence scores reflecting document limitations
              - NEVER make up information to fill gaps
            
            - For ambiguous queries:
              - Address the most likely interpretation first based on document content
              - Note alternative interpretations if documents support them
              - Structure the answer to cover multiple possible intents if documents allow
              - ONLY address interpretations supported by document content
              - Use clear section headings to separate different interpretations
            
            - For complex technical questions:
              - Start with a simplified overview using document terminology
              - Follow with technical details from the documents

The fundamental unit is the **qubit**, which unlike classical bits, can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to superposition.\\n\\nKey concepts in quantum computing include:\\n\\n* **Superposition**: Qubits exist in multiple states at once, allowing quantum computers to process vast amounts of possibilities simultaneously\\n* **Entanglement**: When qubits become correlated, sharing quantum states regardless of distance, creating powerful computational connections\\n* **Quantum Gates**: Operations that manipulate qubit states, similar to how classical computers use logic gates but with quantum mechanical properties\\n\\nUnlike classical computers that use transistors representing 0 or 1, quantum computers can represent many values simultaneously, offering exponential processing capability for certain problems.\\n\\n### Mathematical Foundation\\n\\nIn quantum computing, a qubit's state is represented mathematically as:\\n\\n$$|\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha|0\\rangle + \\beta|1\\rangle$$\\n\\nWhere $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are complex numbers satisfying:\\n\\n$$|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1$$\\n\\nThis formula represents the probability amplitudes for measuring either 0 or 1. When multiple qubits are entangled, their states cannot be described independently, leading to the powerful phenomenon that enables quantum computing's advantages.\\n\\n## Applications of Quantum Computing\\n\\nQuantum computers excel at:\\n\\n1. **Factoring large numbers** - Breaking encryption using Shor's algorithm\\n2. **Quantum system simulation** - Modeling complex molecular and physical systems for drug discovery and material science\\n3. **Optimization problems** - Finding optimal solutions to complex problems with many variables\\n4. **Machine learning** - Enhancing certain algorithms with quantum speedup\\n\\n### Cryptographic Implications\\n\\nShor's algorithm represents a significant threat to current public-key cryptography. The algorithm can factor large numbers in polynomial time, which would break RSA encryption. The mathematical advantage comes from quantum Fourier transforms operating in superposition, as described by:\\n\\n$$\\text{{QFT}}|j\\rangle = \\frac{{1}}{{\\sqrt{{N}}}}\\sum_{{k=0}}^{{N-1}}e^{{2\\pi ijk/N}}|k\\rangle$$\\n\\nThis transformation allows quantum computers to find factors exponentially faster than classical algorithms.\\n\\n## Current Limitations\\n\\nDespite the theoretical promise, quantum computers face significant challenges:\\n\\n* **Decoherence** - Quantum states are extremely fragile and easily disturbed by environmental noise\\n* **Error rates** - Current quantum operations have high error rates requiring correction\\n* **Scalability** - Building machines with enough stable qubits remains difficult\\n\\n### Error Correction Strategies\\n\\nQuantum error correction codes work fundamentally differently from classical error correction. The approach involves encoding a logical qubit across multiple physical qubits to protect against errors. This requires techniques like surface codes that can detect and correct errors without collapsing the quantum state through measurement.\\n\\n## Quantum Programming\\n\\nMost quantum algorithms are implemented using specialized languages and frameworks:\\n\\n```python\\n# Simplified representation of qubit states\\nfrom qiskit import QuantumCircuit\\nqc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)\\nqc.h(0)  # Put qubit 0 in superposition\\nqc.cx(0, 1)  # Entangle qubits 0 and 1\\n```\\n\\nResearchers are actively working on error correction codes and more stable qubit designs. Despite current limitations, quantum computing shows enormous potential for revolutionizing fields from cryptography to drug discovery and materials science in the coming decades.\\n\\n## Comparison: Classical vs. Quantum Computing\\n\\n| Aspect | Classical Computing | Quantum Computing |\\n|--------|-------------------|-------------------|\\n| Basic unit | Bit (0 or 1) | Qubit (superposition of 0 and 1) |\\n| Processing | Sequential | Parallel through superposition |\\n| Algorithms | Deterministic | Probabilistic |\\n| Error handling | Robust | Highly susceptible to noise |\\n| Current status | Mature technology | Emerging technology |\\n| Best applications | General-purpose computing | Specialized problems (factoring, simulation) |\\n\\nThis comparison highlights the complementary nature of classical and quantum approaches, with each excelling in different domains.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n* Document 1 - Basic quantum computing principles and applications\\n* Document 2 - Quantum programming and entanglement concepts\\n* Document 3 - Current limitations and error correction in quantum systems",
